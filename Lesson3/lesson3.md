# Let's create a website with python

Pythons a relatively common language for the backend of development
Pretty sure insta uses python

Basic Terminology
Front end: the stuff you actually see
Backend: takes like info does smthn and then shows something to the viewer

Front end usually uses Html which like adds elements
css which makes _pretty_
and javascript which adds functionality

Instead of dealing with that stuff we can just use libraries like django or flask to deal with that and then we can just use python

Flask is relatively simple and lightweight
Djangoo is more complicated but also allows for more stuff

Insta also uses Django

Let's first download the packages to the venv
For Windows:
pip install flask
pip install django

For Mac:
pip3 install flask
pip3 install django

_In case you haven't realized by now only diff in syntax is that macs got a 3 at the end of pip or python while windows don't_

Start off with
**hello.py**
then continue to
**Django_basics.py**
