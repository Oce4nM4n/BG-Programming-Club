WOOOHOOOO its programming club yayyyyyyyy

Try doing:

Python3 -m venv .venv
or for windows
Python -m venv .venv

This creates a virtual environment where you can like install packages and things
This way you don't clutter local python install + when woorking with same packages but different versions errors may happen so just having correct version in venv is useful so no hassle
